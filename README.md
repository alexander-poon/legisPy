## Motivation

Civic Engagement with Data Science. Inspired by a discussion at a [Code for Nashville](https://github.com/code-for-nashville) brigade meeting. Data from [OpenStates](https://openstates.org).

High level goals:

1. Identify legislation a person might pay attention to given location, interests
2. Summary of a legislator's body of work
